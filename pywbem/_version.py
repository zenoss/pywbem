Version of the pywbem package.

Note: The package version is not defined here, but determined dynamically by
the `pbr` package from Git information.
"""

# A note on the approach for importing pbr and invoking its VersionInfo():
# The documentation shows the __version__ variable defined below. For
# unknown reasons, the variable is not shown in the documentation when
# VersionInfo() is invoked without specifying a module path. Also, just
# importing pbr does not work because of the way the pbr package makes its
# submodules available.

#: The full version of this package including any development levels, as a
#: :term:`string`.
#:
#: Possible formats for this version string are:
#:
#: * "M.N.P.devNNN": Development level NNN of a not yet released assumed M.N.P
#:   version
#: * "M.N.P": A released M.N.P version

import pbr.version
try:
    __version__ = pbr.version.VersionInfo('pywbem').release_string()
except:
    # Hard coded the string because pbr was causing a weird load error:
    # "Versioning for this project requires either an sdist tarball, or access to an upstream git repository".
    __version__ = 'pywbem-0.14.3'
