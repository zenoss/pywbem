This directory contains the tests for PyWBEM.  You should try and run
them if you are doing development on the code.  (-:

A neat trick for running the tests against a development branch is to
check out a copy of the PyWBEM source as a subdirectory of the
testsuite, like this:

$ cd pywbem/testsuite
$ svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pywbem/trunk pywbem
[hack on pywbem code or testsuite]
$ ./runtests

To run the CIM operations test, the test.mof file must be loaded in to
the repository.  Under Pegasus, this done by setting the 
repositoryIsDefaultProvider configuration variable to true.

# cimconfig -s repositoryIsDefaultInstanceProvider=true -p
# cimmof < test.mof

Pegasus must be restarted in order for the change to take effect.
