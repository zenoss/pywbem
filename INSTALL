Installation

PyWBEM can be installed quite easily using the standard Python
distutils that is part of the Python distribution. PyWBEM is built
using the following shell command. Since PyWBEM is a pure-Python
module, there isn't much that is done during the build process.

  $ python setup.py build
  running build
  running build_py
  creating build
  creating build/lib
  creating build/lib/pywbem
  copying cim_xml.py -> build/lib/pywbem
  [...]

PyWBEM is installed, as root, with the following shell command. This
copies the PyWBEM source to the Python site-packages directory where
it can be loaded by the interpreter.

  # python setup.py install
  running install
  running build
  running build_py
  running install_lib
  copying build/lib/pywbem/cim_xml.py -> /usr/lib/python [...]
  [...]

If you do not have root access, or would like to install PyWBEM in a
different directory, use the --install-lib option when installing.

  $ python setup.py install --install-lib $HOME/python/lib
  running install
  running build
  running build_py
  running install_lib
  creating /home/tpot/python/lib
  creating /home/tpot/python/lib/pywbem
  copying build/lib/pywbem/cim_xml.py -> /home/tpot/python/lib/pywbem
  [...]

To test that PyWBEM is sucessfully installed, start up a Python
interpreter and try to import the pywbem module.

  $ python
  Python 2.3.5 (#2, Mar 26 2005, 17:32:32)
  [GCC 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-12)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import pywbem
  >>>

If you do not see any text after the import command, PyWBEM has been
sucessfully installed.
